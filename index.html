                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span>1. Is it (relatively) cheap? (It always has to be under ‚Ç¨150k)</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    2. Is it excellent value?  (ie. What would the same house cost if it was in the UK, Germany, or Denmark?)
                                </span>
                            </li>

                                <span>
                                    3. Could we see ourselves living there? Would it make a good residence or vacation home?
                                </span>
                            </li>

                            There are many visa options ‚Äî student, business manager, work, spouse visa ‚Äî but you‚Äôll need to figure that out first if you plan to live there year round.

                            Spain has a number of factors that make *some* real estate relatively cheap. Mainly:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    1. High level of population concentration around big cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, M√°laga, and Mallorca.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    Spanish buyers prefer new homes to older ones (85% vs 15%).
                                </span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Many (though not all) of the houses we feature are in less populated areas that have limited job options and less buyer demand. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="flex-container-row">
                        <img src="assets/img/icons/arrow.png" alt="arrow image" class="arrowIconRollOut">
                        <h3>I'm interested in one of the houses you posted. How can I buy it?</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="hidden" id="8">
                        <p>
                            Step 1: All of the seller contact information for the houses are available in the weekly email newsletter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Step 2: You can directly reach out to the agent to arrange a viewing or request further details. Many realtors can at least have a conversation or exchange emails in English. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="flex-container-row">
                        <img src="assets/img/icons/arrow.png" alt="arrow image" class="arrowIconRollOut">
                        <h3>Do I need to physically be in Spain to buy a house?</h3>

                    <div class="hidden" id="9">
                        <p>
                            No. You can use an intermediary who will act as your power of attorney throughout the process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That said, I would *highly* recommend visiting the property in person before putting in an offer. It‚Äôs hard to get the ‚Äòfeel‚Äô of a house and neighborhood from only photos or video.
                        </p>
